Focusing on Citizen's Eco-Drive line, Studiografica was contracted to create a touch-interactive presentation for Citizen's digital campaigns to organize and showcase Citizen's outdoor, in-store, direct and digital advertising.

This web app was specialized for the Windows Surface Pro and presented high-definition videos, touch-sensitive 3D image rotators, and front/back ad flipping animations, built using extending Jquery Mobile, customizing a CSS3/JS touch slider, and copious amounts of Fig Newtons.
