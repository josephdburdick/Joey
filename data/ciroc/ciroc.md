P. Diddy's media team BlueFlame used Studiografica to build Ciroc.com to help promote the
brand, so I had the opportunity to build a site for a well known vodka brand. This project
ran smoothly on iPads and used hash-bang address bar manipulation to seamlessly fade
between different pages of the site. All code was written without a framework.

My favorite part of this project was the drink detail view. When you clicked the next or previous
button it would change the URL hash to keep it bookmarkable and the drinks would slide into view horizontally.
