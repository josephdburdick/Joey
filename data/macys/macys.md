An in-store Macy's training app for employees specialized for the iPad.
The first project was Macy's Diamonds educated
employees on the physical properties of diamonds to improve
sales tactics.

Tests were developed with customized jQuery Mobile forms to quiz and track employees' progress which were recorded live using a custom .Net framework.

This very successful project brought many brands under the Macy's umbrella including Bulova, Caravelle, and Tommy Hilfiger.
