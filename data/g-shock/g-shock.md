The G-Shock website was 1 of 3 websites that were made for Casio in a period spanning ~1 month.
[Protrek](http://www.protrek.casio.com), [Edifice](http://edifice.casio.com),
and [Baby-G](http://www.baby-g.com) were all developed nearly simultaneously.

One of my favorite things about developing this site was the watches section. It was a serious step for Casio
towards progressive enhancement, so finally leaving many graphical elements behind and using CSS to do it's job.
I also developed custom CSS and JS
so no matter what width and height the watch came in from the back-end it always fit perfectly into the grid views.
