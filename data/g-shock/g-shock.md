The G-Shock website was one of three Casio websites, Protrek, Edifice, and Baby-G, developed simultaneously in a period spanning approximately one month.

One of my favorite things about developing this site is the Watches section. It was a serious step for Casio towards progressive enhancement, leaving many graphic elements behind allowing CSS to do it's job. I also developed custom CSS and JavaScript to ensure the watch image from the back-end fit perfectly into the grid view regardless of image size.
