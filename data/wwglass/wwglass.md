Pilkington Planar structural glass systems have a proven track record in the most demanding applications. Architects know they can call on Pilkington to create roofs, canopies, soaring facades or even clad entire buildings in glass and receive a total commitment for the design, supply and warranty of the entire, integrated system.

W&W Glass came to Studiografica to create a cross platform web portfolio to show off their beautiful glass structures. They had wonderful photography of their work which always makes me excited. Once the design came through I made my own tweaks to the portfolio section to make sure there was a good experience on tablets.

Aside from appropriately responding to all touch, the portfolio section also featured a list of locations that used W&W and Pilkington. With your finger you could easily move up and down the list then touch the different shots associated with that particular site. The animations between locations looked great and remains one of my favorite things I ever worked on at Studiografica.
