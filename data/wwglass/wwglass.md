W&W Glass contracted Studiografica to create a cross-platform web portfolio to showcase their beautiful glass structures using wonderful photography of their work which always makes me excited. Once the design came through I made my own tweaks to the portfolio section to make sure there was a good experience on tablets.

In addition to appropriately responding to all touch, the portfolio section also features a list of locations that have used W&W and Pilkington. Using their finger users can easily move up and down the list and touch the different shots associated with that particular site. The animation between locations looks great and remains one of my favorite projects I completed at Studiografica.
