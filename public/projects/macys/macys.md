An in-store Macy's training app for employees specialized for the iPad 2.
The first project was Macy's Diamonds educated
employees on the physical properties of diamonds to improve
sales tactics.

Tests were developed with customized Jquery Mobile forms to quiz and track employees' progress which were recorded live using a custom .Net framework.

This project was very successful which brought on many
brands underneath the Macy's brand umbrella including
Bulova, Caravelle, Tommy Hilfiger, and others.
It also peaked interest with Citizen who later hired our services to implement a similar platform to
show (their digital campaigns)[citizen-watches].
