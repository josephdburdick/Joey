#Joey 2016
Joey is the work and play of Joseph D Burdick.

Under the hood, the site is a significant upgrade to the last live version which was deployed in 2014 and was powered by PHP and JSON. The content of the site pulling in content via Frontmatter / Markdown, into asynchronously-loaded views generated from JSON and powered by React Router. The React components loaded and injected with data from these container views are styled via PostCSS and rendered in the viewport.

TODO:
- [ ] Add images to Blue Chair Bay Rum
- [ ] Investigate pushState with async routes to prevent page losing it's scroll position
- [ ] Lazyload project images

opinionated boilerplate and tooling for creating modern stand-alone web applications (aka [SPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application)s) for a serverless architecture.
