During my tenure at a startup called OurWeddingDay I helped design the original Vendor Platform what would later be purchased by David's Bridal. I changed my focus to development after OurWeddingDay and David's Bridal but once David's Bridal got around to using what I helped build they hired me to help. I designed, developed, and helped implement the brand new bride-facing and admin-facing Vendor Platform that is currently in use.
