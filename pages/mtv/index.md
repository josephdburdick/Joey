MTV's Digital Product Head at Viacom International requested visual design
for their upcoming iOS app with a tight turnaround (3 days). This app, scheduled for
release in Summer 2014, will stream apps to the user in a smart radio-esque style.
You put in an artist you want to watch or keywords you're looking for like
white dress or fisheye and it produces a non-stop stream of music videos.
