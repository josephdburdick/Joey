#### Hi.<br>I'm Joseph Burdick.<br>Or forever according to Mom, Joey.<br><br>I make websites and web apps.

I'm a developer with 17 years of experience and I currently reside in beautiful Brooklyn, New York.
After developing a very popular social website in high school, I was hooked. Development is my passion and as a full-time technologist I love keeping up with the latest and greatest technology.
