### Hi.<br>I'm Joseph Burdick, or forever according to Mom, Joey.

I am a full-stack designer and developer with over 17 years of experience living in Brooklyn, New York.
After developing a very popular social website in high school, I was hooked. Development is my passion and as a full-time technologist I love keeping up with the latest and greatest technology.
