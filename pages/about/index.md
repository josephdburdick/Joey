#### Hi.

I'm Joseph Burdick.

I make websites and web apps for clients big and small.

I'm a developer with 17 years of experience and I currently reside in beautiful Brooklyn, New York.
After developing a very popular social website in high school, I was hooked. Development is my
passion and as a full-time technologist I love keeping up with the latest tech to solve problems
efficiently.

Catch me on any of the social networks below!
