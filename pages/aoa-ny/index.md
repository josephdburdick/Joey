The Africa Oceania Americas Tribal Art Fair is a client that came about after my work for Tambaran Gallery. The site was designed and developed in less than a week. It works across all browsers and features a subtle fading background that changes between examples of art featured at the fair every year. They also use me for graphical e-blasts that appear correct in every email platform.
