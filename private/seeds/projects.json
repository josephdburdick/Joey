Tests were developed with customized Jquery Mobile forms to quiz and track employees ' progress which were recorded live using a custom.Net framework. This project was very successful which brought on many brands underneath the Macy 's brand umbrella including Bulova, Caravelle, Tommy Hilfiger, and others. It also peaked interest with Citizen who later hired our services to implement a similar platform to show[#!/work=citizen](their digital campaigns)."

W & W Glass came to Studiografica to create a cross platform web portfolio to show off their beautiful glass structures.They had wonderful photography of their work which always makes me excited.Once the design came through I made my own tweaks to the portfolio section to make sure there was a good experience on tablets. Aside from appropriately responding to all touch, the portfolio section also featured a list of locations that used W & W and Pilkington.With your finger you could easily move up and down the list then touch the different shots associated with that particular site. The animations between locations looked great and remains one of my favorite things I ever worked on at Studiografica."
